Questions required finding the prime number between two imputs. In order to solve this, started to study the ways as my previous study stopped on this matter.
Found the algorithm called __"Sieve of Eratosthenes"__

Although I have got the initial understanding, further study and repetition will be required to fully utilize this algorithm.
