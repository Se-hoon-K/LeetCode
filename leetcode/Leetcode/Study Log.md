Questions required finding the prime number between two imputs. In order to solve this, started to study the ways as my previous study stopped on this matter.
Found the algorithm called __"Sieve of Eratosthenes"__

Although I have got the initial understanding, further study and repetition will be required to fully utilize this algorithm.

Question 2379 was an easy level challenge, not much to think about.
Re-use on charAt() function was good.
Will do further study on other user's solutions

### additional Note, used leetcode provided answer using queue and ArrayList, but the time complexity was too much

Question 3208 was on moving slit windows. Idea came quickly but the implementation was difficult.
